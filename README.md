Sonar Rock vs Mine Prediction 🚀
Welcome to my first ever Machine Learning project!
This project marks the beginning of my journey into the exciting world of ML and AI.

In this project, I built a model to predict whether a sonar signal bounced back from a Rock or a Mine, using real-world sonar data.
It’s a small but powerful step toward exploring data, building intelligent models, and solving real problems.

Technologies Used 🛠️
Python

Scikit-learn

Pandas

Numpy

What I Learned 📚
Understanding and cleaning data

Training and testing machine learning models

Evaluating performance and accuracy

Most importantly: staying curious and never stopping learning!

About This Journey ✨
This project is not just about predicting rocks or mines —
It’s about taking the first step toward a future filled with possibilities in AI, Machine Learning, and beyond.

"Every expert was once a beginner." 🚀
